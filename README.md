# react-in-wp-admin

Boilerplate setup for a React & ES6 WordPress plugin.

This plugin adds a menu item to your wp-admin, which will load a very simple react component.

It's a work in progress! Feel free to open any issues and submit PR's :)

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. `npm install` within plugin directory.

```
cd /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wp-react-boilerplate
npm install
gulp
```

## Gulp
This repo uses Gulp and webpack to concatenate files.

`gulp` - (default) Will run build tasks for css and react js

`gulp watch` - Will watch files and update when changed.
